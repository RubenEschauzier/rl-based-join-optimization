## Stardog Query Environment (WIP)

Query environment for stardog that allows running full queries, 
count queries for cardinality estimation, and can process query output to obtain a reward signal.

Blazegraph supports fully tuning the join plan using query hints, thus all types of query plans can be considered. 

Possible rewards signals are: intermediate results generated and total execution time (WIP).
